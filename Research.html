<!--<h3>Overview</h3>-->
<p class="one">
The world is becoming increasingly connected, from the Internet of Things and communication networks to Big Data and Blockchain. Due to ubiquitous connectivity, a vast array of new problems has emerged. My research focuses on the modeling, analysis, and decision making of networked systems. A brief description of recent projects follow.

<p><b style=font-size:21px>Beyond Age of Information (AoI): Real-Time Sampling and Estimation</b></p>
<p class="one">

In the IoT applications, information is to be collectedand communicated real-time within a decentralized network. We consider the problem of real-time sampling of Markov physical processes for (timely) estimation in (random access) networks where nodes have to decide when to sample, with whom to communicate, and what to transmit in a decentralized manner. The main object is to develop theoretical foundations and algorithmic designs for interesting tradeoffs between sampling rate, throughput, reliability, and estimation error which we aim to characterize. 
To partially address this issue, some works (e.g., the project "Information Freshness in Distributed Systems" below) have proposed centralized and decentralized multiple  access schemes to minimize the metric of AoI. Nonetheless, it has remained open how such designs can inform near-optimal designs for real-time sampling and estimation. This work establishes this bridge and goes beyond AoI minimization.

<p><b style=font-size:21px>Information Freshness in Distributed Systems</b></p>
<p class="one">Distributed (communication) networks have witnessed rapid growth in the past few decades and they have laid a path to the integration of intelligence into cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, smart cities, as well as healthcare systems. The freshness and timeliness of information is of significant importance in distributed systems. For example, in applications of remote sensing, estimation, control, high-rate communication, financial trading, and social networks must ensure timely communication of data. In practice, it is not always effective to update the information as fast as possible for it may cause further delay in the network queues. The main object is to propose network communication strategies which are not only reliable and high speed, but perform satisfactorily for time-sensitive applications, which implies to consider the problems of minimizing the age of information over distributed systems (under some conditions).</br>

<p><b style=font-size:21px>Economics of Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks</b></p>
<p class="one">The advent of cognitive radio technology promises to effectively address the limited availability of spectrum that has been deterring the proliferation of wireless services. Wireless service providers are divided into (i) mobile network operators (MNOs) that lease spectrum from a regulator, and (ii) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that obtain spectrum from one or more MNOs. Although traditionally wireless service has been offered only by MNOs, in recent years, the number of MVNOs has been rapidly growing. The number of MVNOs worldwide increased by 70 percent between June 2010 and June 2015. Even some MNOs developed their own MVNOs. The economic incentives for cooperation among wireless service providers are evaluated. We seek to understand that each wireless service provider intelligently determines who it would cooperate with, when it would cooperate, and how it would deploy and share its resources during such cooperation, so as to maximize its individual incentive.

<p><b style=font-size:21px>Online-Offline Supply Chain Management</b></p>
<p class="one">
Online retailing has rapidly grown since 2011 in China. It seems more efficient than that by brick-and-mortar retailers. To further amend the possible drawbacks of online selling, some online retailers have set up more than one selling channel in the competing market. We maximize the utilities of entities in online-offline chains with assists from logistics management, pricing strategies, inventory management, and profits-sharing.</br>
