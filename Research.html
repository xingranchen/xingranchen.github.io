<p><b style=font-size:25px> Research Fields</b></p>
<p class="one">My research interests are in the intersection of <b>Information Theory</b>, <b>Machine Learning</b>, and <b>Network Science</b>. I am particularly interested in fundamental limits of freshness-oriented communications.

<p><b style=font-size:23px> Timeliness of Information Transfer in Wireless Networks</b></p>
<p class="one">
Information freshness is a new system design criterion motivated by this observation that information usually has the highest value when it is fresh. For example, think about system status updates or samples that are taken from a Markov process: Once a new update packet or sample packet is given, all older packets and the information they carry become insignificant. Information freshness is quantified by the metric of the age of information (AoI) and it captures both how often information is transmitted and how much delay information experiences in a network. To keep the information freshest is an everlasting goal in time-sensitive applications, such as cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, smart cities, as well as healthcare systems. Our research focuses on developing novel strategies that can minimize age in wireless networks and we further investigate fundamental tradeoffs between the AoI and other metrics such as estimation error, communication rate, channel throughput, delay, transmission cost, etc.

<p><b style=font-size:23px> Real-time Learning in Networks</b></p>
<p class="one">
We investigate timely inference, detection and control for processes that not only evolve over time but also on an underlying network, such as the spread of an infectious disease in a contact network, the spread of a computer virus on the world wide web, or the spread of opinions/product adaption/misinformation in social networks. How to "contain the spread" (or "maximize the influence") as soon as possible is another instance where timeliness is crucial because ''infected'' nodes who are not ''isolated'' may "infect" others. Our goal is to develop sequential and adaptive learning frameworks for deciding which nodes to ''test'' depending on observations. In general, especially in settings where decision-making is decentralized or 
based on partial or noisy observations, it remains open to proposing novel learning frameworks. We identify interesting tradeoffs between maximizing reward and optimal information extraction and developing algorithmic frameworks toward understanding such tradeoffs.

The world is becoming increasingly connected, from the Internet of Things and communication networks to Big Data and Blockchain. Due to ubiquitous connectivity, a vast array of new problems has emerged. My research focuses on the modeling, analysis, and decision making of networked systems. A brief description of recent projects follow.
</p>


<p><b style=font-size:21px> Testing and Isolation Policies in Contact Networks</b></p>
<p class="one"> 
The information (in social networks or the IoT applications) is often governed by processes that evolve over time and/or space (e.g. on an underlying graph) and they may not be stationary or stable. It is important to design efficient strategies to collect real-time information for timely estimation and inference. For example, how to design testing and isolation strategies to track or contain an infectious disease such as COVID-19? We need to develop sequential and adaptive frameworks to decide at each time which nodes should be examined in order to best track and contral the spread process under a given budget. These frameworks can be straightforwardly extended to other allications such as remote estimation in the IoT systems, misinformation spreading in social networks, etc. </br>

<p><b style=font-size:21px>Information Freshness and Beyond</b></p>
<p class="one">Distributed (communication) networks have witnessed rapid growth in the past few decades and they have laid a path to the integration of intelligence into cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, smart cities, as well as healthcare systems. The freshness and timeliness of information is of significant importance in distributed systems. For example, in applications of remote sensing, estimation, control, high-rate communication, financial trading, and social networks must ensure timely communication of data. In practice, it is not always effective to update the information as fast as possible for it may cause further delay in the network queues. The main object is to propose network communication strategies which are not only reliable and high speed, but perform satisfactorily for time-sensitive applications, which implies to consider the problems of minimizing the Age of Information (AoI, a metric of information freshness) over distributed systems (under some conditions). Furthermore, in the IoT applications, information is to be collected and communicated real-time within a decentralized network. So other important objects arise: develop theoretical foundations and algorithmic designs for tradeoffs between AoI, sampling rate, thoughput, reliability, and estimation error. In these situations, nodes need to decide when to sample, with whom to communicate, and what to transmit in a decentralized manner. </br>

<p><b style=font-size:21px>Economics of Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks</b></p>
<p class="one">The advent of cognitive radio technology promises to effectively address the limited availability of spectrum that has been deterring the proliferation of wireless services. Wireless service providers are divided into (i) mobile network operators (MNOs) that lease spectrum from a regulator, and (ii) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that obtain spectrum from one or more MNOs. Although traditionally wireless service has been offered only by MNOs, in recent years, the number of MVNOs has been rapidly growing. The number of MVNOs worldwide increased by 70 percent between June 2010 and June 2015. Even some MNOs developed their own MVNOs. The economic incentives for cooperation among wireless service providers are evaluated. We seek to understand that each wireless service provider intelligently determines who it would cooperate with, when it would cooperate, and how it would deploy and share its resources during such cooperation, so as to maximize its individual incentive.

<p class="one">
Online retailing has rapidly grown since 2011 in China. It seems more efficient than that by brick-and-mortar retailers. To further amend the possible drawbacks of online selling, some online retailers have set up more than one selling channel in the competing market. We maximize the utilities of entities in online-offline chains with assists from logistics management, pricing strategies, inventory management, and profits-sharing.</br>
