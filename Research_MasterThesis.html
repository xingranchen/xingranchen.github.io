<h3> Description</h3>
<p> 
Wireless service providers (SPs) are divided into (i) mobile network operators (MNOs) that lease spectrum from a regulator like FCC, and (ii) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that obtain spectrum from one or more MNOs. MVNOs can distinguish their plans from
MNOs by bundling their service with other products, offering different pricing plans for End-Users (EUs), or building a good reputation through a better customer service. Although
traditionally wireless service has been offered only by MNOs, in recent years, the number of MVNOs has been rapidly growing. The number of MVNOs increased by 70 percent worldwide, during June 2010-June 2015 reaching 1,017 as of June 2015. Even some MNOs developed their own MVNOs. An example of which is Cricket wireless which is owned by AT&T and offers a prepaid wireless service to EUs. Another example of MVNOs is the Google’s Project Fi in which the customer’s service is handled using Wi-Fi hotspots wherever/whenever they exist; elsewhere the service is handled using the spectrum of a number of MNOs, eg, Sprint, T-Mobile or U.S. Cellular networks.
</p>
<p>
In this project, we consider the economics of the interaction among MNOs and MVNOs. We seek to understand why and under what conditions the MNOs cooperate with the
MVNOs by offering some of their spectrum to the MVNOs, and thereby inviting competition for a common pool of EUs. We consider scenarios where the MNOs decide on acquiring new spectrum, and in exchange for a fee offer those to MVNOs, which decide to acquire some of the spectrum offered. The SPs decide on their pricing strategies for the EUs, and the EUs decide to opt for one of them, or neither, if the access fees and the qualities of service are not satisfactory. The spectrum acquisition and pricing decisions of the SPs determine their respective profits.We characterize their equilibrium choices. We obtain metrics that quantify the cooperation and competition of the SPs in terms of their spectrum investments and subscriptions of EUs, which help quantify the interplay between competition and cooperation under the equilibrium choices.
