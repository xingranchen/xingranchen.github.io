<h3> Description</h3>
<p> 
Sending status updates in a timely manner has significant importance in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In practice, it is not always effective to update the information as fast as possible for it may cause further delay in the
network queues. To measure the timeliness of information at
a remote system, the concept of Age of Information (AoI) was introduced in 2011. AoI measures, at the receiving side, how much time has passed since the generation time of the
latest received packet. 
</p>

<p>
In this project, we aim to shed light on the interplay between AoI and (channel/network) coding in the context of broadcast packet erasure channels (BPECs) with feedback. From coding theory, the entire capacity region of two-user BPECs with feedback can be attained by XORing overheard packets. More precisely, suppose a packet p, intended for user 1, is broadcasted and only received at user 2. Scheduling algorithms re-transmit this packet because it is not received at its intended receiver. However, one may be able to exploit coding opportunities by tracking such packets (and this is possible through the available feedback). For example, in a similar manner, a packet q, intended for user 2, may get
transmitted and received only at receiver 1. Now instead of re-transmitting p and q in two uses of the network, one can transmit the XOR packet which is simultaneously useful for both users.
